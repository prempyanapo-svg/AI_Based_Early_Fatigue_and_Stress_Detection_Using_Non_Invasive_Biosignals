# Project Report (Summary)

This is a short summary of the Word report.

## Abstract
Stress can reduce concentration and performance, especially when it builds up over time. This project builds a Python AI system that detects stress using SWELL-KW physiology features.

## Originality features
- Personalized baseline calibration
- Early-warning trend detection
- Simple explanations for predictions

## Hypothesis
Time pressure and interruptions will produce measurable changes in HRV and skin conductance compared to neutral baseline.
